This is currently a raw project.
General aspiration comes from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PJh2K-jdU&t=151s
Currently I am interested if this can somehow lead to an approximation of N-dimensional surfaces and improvement of gradient descent method.
Also I want to construct vector fields with complex behaviour as I believe it may help me approximate complex economic simulation in my another repo for a larger scale.
